                    <h1>Jantar Mantar</h1>
                    <p>Jantar Mantar was constructed between 1724 and 1734 by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II, a ruler with
                        a keen interest in astronomy. He built this observatory to study celestial objects and gather
                        astronomical data. The name "Jantar Mantar" is derived from two Sanskrit words: "Yantra,"
                        meaning instrument, and "Mantra," meaning formula. </p>

                    <p>The temple is believed to have been constructed in the 14th century, although the site has been
                        associated with Lord Brahma for centuries. According to legend, the temple was built at the spot
                        where Lord Brahma dropped a lotus flower, marking the creation of Pushkar Lake. The temple
                        attracts thousands of devotees, especially during the Pushkar Camel Fair, which celebrates the
                        cultural heritage of the region. </p>

            <div class="info">
                <p>The Thar Desert, also known as the Great Indian Desert, stretches across the northwestern part of
                    India and is primarily located in Rajasthan. It covers an area of about 200,000 square kilometers,
                    making it the largest desert in India and the 18th largest in the world.
                    The landscape of the Thar Desert is characterized by vast stretches of sand dunes, arid plains, and
                    sparse vegetation. The desert experiences extreme temperatures, with scorching heat during the day
                    and cooler temperatures at night. Despite its harsh conditions, the Thar Desert is home to a unique
                    ecosystem, with several species of plants and animals that have adapted to survive in this
                    challenging environment.
