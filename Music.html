            <div class="info">
                <p>The dholak is a traditional percussion instrument widely used in Rajasthani folk music and various
                    cultural celebrations. It is a two-headed drum made from wood, with one side covered by a thick
                    membrane, typically made from animal skin, while the other side is often left open. The dholak's
                    distinct sound is characterized by a deep bass tone and a sharp, resonant treble, making it a
                    versatile instrument for accompanying dance and song.

                    In Rajasthani culture, the dholak plays a central role in festive occasions, such as weddings,
                    religious ceremonies, and community gatherings. It is often played in pairs, with musicians using
                    their hands to strike the drumheads in rhythmic patterns. The dholak provides the heartbeat of
                    Rajasthani music, driving the tempo and energy of folk dances like Ghoomar and Kalbelia.

                    Rajasthan, a land of vibrant culture and rich heritage, is renowned for its traditional music, which
                    is deeply intertwined with the state’s history and identity. The traditional instruments of
                    Rajasthan, such as the sarangi, dholak, shehnai, and harmonium, have been pivotal in conveying the
                    stories and emotions of the people. However, the contemporary landscape has brought a wave of
                    change, blending these age-old sounds with modern influences.

                    In recent years, Rajasthani musicians have embraced fusion genres, incorporating elements from
                    various musical traditions worldwide. This has led to the innovative use of traditional instruments
                    alongside electronic music, jazz, and pop. Artists are experimenting with the sarangi, often
                    integrating it with electric guitars and synthesizers, creating a unique sound that appeals to a
                    younger audience. The dholak and dhol are now frequently featured in modern band setups, bridging
                    the gap between traditional folk and contemporary music.Music festivals and platforms showcasing
                    Rajasthani folk music have also emerged, providing artists with opportunities to reach global
                    audiences.</p>
