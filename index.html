                        <p>Blue Pottery in Rajasthan traces its origins back to the early 19th century when it was
                            introduced to Jaipur by Sawai Ram Singh II. Inspired by the blue glazed tiles of Persian and
                            Mughal architecture, the local artisans began experimenting and soon developed a style that
                            was distinctly their own. The traditional motifs include floral patterns, animals, and
                            geometrical designs, often depicted in vibrant blue hues.</p>
